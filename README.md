# Alex Taylor

This is a starter project for web development with no frameworks and minimal
dependencies. It is written in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is a simple
website and showcase of some fun things you can do with basic HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project.

To run the live server, first install this extenstion:

Once this is installed, simply right click on the index.html and press
"Open with Live Server". Play around with the buttons and see what happens!

## Testing

To run the tests for the project, run the following command:

```bash
npm test
```
